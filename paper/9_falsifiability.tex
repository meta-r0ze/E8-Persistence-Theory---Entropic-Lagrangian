\section{Falsifiability: Structural Kill-Switches}
\label{sec:falsifiability}

Unlike Effective Field Theories, which can accommodate new particles by adding Lagrangian terms, the Entropic Lagrangian is structurally closed. The integers $\mathbb{S} = \{\Delta, \nu, \sigma, \chi\}$ completely saturate the degrees of freedom. Therefore, the theory presents specific "Hard Constraints" that serve as immediate falsification criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Spin-2 Limit (No Supergravity):} The lattice projection capacity ($D=4$) strictly prohibits fundamental fields with spin $>2$. The discovery of a spin-3/2 gravitino or higher-spin gauge field would refute the manifold projection constraint.
    
    \item \textbf{The Perturbative Gravity Prohibition:} We derive General Relativity as an emergent hydrodynamic limit (System VI). This requires that gravity be asymptotically safe or non-perturbative in the UV. The discovery that gravity follows standard perturbative quantization (like QED) at the Planck scale would falsify the bulk regulator derivation.
    
    \item \textbf{The Fourth Generation Prohibition:} The chiral channel capacity is saturated at $\nu=16$ (3 generations + neutrinos). The discovery of a 4th generation of fermions would imply $\nu > 16$, falsifying the $E_8 \to D_4 \oplus D_4$ substrate hypothesis.
    
    \item \textbf{Lorentz Violation at Low Energy:} The derivation of the Metric Signature relies on the Bandwidth Limit ($c_{eff}=1$). Any experimental confirmation of Lorentz violation (e.g., energy-dependent speed of light) at energies $E \ll M_P$ would invalidate the channel capacity argument.
