\section{Numerical Validation}
To verify the theoretical derivations, we implemented a suite of computational audits simulating the physics of the projected $E_8$ lattice. These simulations act as "Kill-Switches": any deviation from the predicted values (Stiffness $\kappa=1$, Mass=0, $c=1$) would falsify the geometric hypothesis. The complete source code is available\footnote{All computational audits referenced in this paper are available at: \url{https://github.com/meta-r0ze/E8-Persistence-Theory-1}}.

\subsection{The Emergent Gravity Kill-Switch}

We verified the derivation of gravity as a Goldstone mode (System VI) through two independent lattice simulations: dynamic wave propagation and static potential relaxation.

\textbf{Test A: Dynamic Stiffness (Gravitational Waves)}
We injected a transverse-traceless metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ onto a $16^4$ lattice and measured the entropic action cost.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vacuum Stiffness:} $\kappa = 1.000000$ (Matches Einstein-Hilbert).
    \item \textbf{Effective Light Speed:} $c_{eff} = 1.000000$ (Lorentz Invariance preserved).
    \item \textbf{Mass Term:} $m^2 = 0.000000$ (Massless Goldstone mode verified).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Test B: Static Capacity (Newtonian Limit)}
We simulated a static mass defect on a $96^4$ lattice ($8.5 \times 10^7$ nodes) and relaxed the system to minimize entropic action. Using a rolling-window regression to isolate the bulk behavior from boundary screening:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scaling Law:} The potential follows a power law $\Phi(r) \propto r^\beta$ with $\beta = -1.997 \pm 0.003$.
    \item \textbf{Agreement:} This matches the Green's function for 4D gravity ($1/r^2$) to within $\mathbf{0.17\%}$, definitively ruling out screened (Yukawa) or lower-dimensional interactions.
    \item \textbf{Flux Conservation:} The information flux satisfies Gauss's Law in 4D, with a mean variation of $6.4\%$ across the bulk, confirming that the ``Capacity Deficit" behaves as a conserved charge (Mass).
\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Left:} The static potential $\Delta n(r)$ measured on a $96^4$ lattice (blue dots) recovers the Newtonian inverse-square law with a fitted slope of $-1.997$, matching the theoretical 4D Green's function ($-2.00$) to within $0.15\%$. 
    \textbf{Right:} The information flux integral is conserved across the bulk radius (Coefficient of Variation $\approx 6.4\%$), verifying that lattice capacity behaves as a conserved topological charge obeying Gauss's Law.}
