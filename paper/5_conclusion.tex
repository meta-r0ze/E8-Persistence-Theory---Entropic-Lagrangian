\section{Conclusion}
This derivation establishes the \textit{form} of the Entropic Lagrangian.

In the next paper \textit{The Geometric Constants}, we calculate the \textit{values} of the coupling constants ($\alpha_s$, $\sin^2\theta_W$), mass scales ($v$, $m_H$, $M_P$), and hierarchy ratios directly from the substrate invariants $\mathbb{S}$, demonstrating that the Standard Model has zero free parameters.
